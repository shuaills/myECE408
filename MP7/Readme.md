## Lab7 (MP7) SpMV
### Objective

The purpose of this lab is to implement a SpMV (Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication) kernel for an input sparse matrix based
on the Jagged Diagonal Storage (JDS) transposed format. A diagram demonstrating the JDS transposed format is shown below:

You will need the URL to your submission to complete the first question of your lab7 quiz. The quiz is autograded, and the URL is saved for regrading purpose. Make sure to answer each question before turning in the quiz. The lab and quiz due April 21 at 8pm.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, make sure that:

* You have reviewed lectures on sparse methods
* You have completed MP6

### Instructions

Edit the kernel and the host function in the file to implement sparse matrix-vector multiplication using the JDS format. The kernel shall
be launched so that each thread will generate one output Y element. The kernel should have each thread to use the appropriate elements of
the JDS data array, the JDS col index array, JDS row index array, and the JDS transposed col ptr array to generate one Y element.

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is demarcated by the `//@@` comment lines.
